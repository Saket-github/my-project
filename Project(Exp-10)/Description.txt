WebRTC Multi-Party Conference — Problem Statement

Goal:-----
--Design and implement a multi-party audio/video conferencing prototype using WebRTC for peer-to-peer media exchange and a Node.js + WebSocket signaling server for session coordination. The client is built in React, supporting small-group mesh calls with live controls, screen sharing, and adaptive quality management.

Core Components:-----
--Signaling Server (Node.js + WebSocket)
--Handles room create/join/leave.
--Relays SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates.
--Broadcasts participant presence and updates.
--Uses MongoDB for storing rooms, participants, and basic call logs.
--Supports JWT authentication and room-scoped tokens.
--WebRTC Peer Connections
--P2P mesh architecture (small rooms).
--Manages audio/video/screen tracks with dynamic add/remove and renegotiation.
--Auto ICE restarts and STUN/TURN for NAT traversal.
--Detects connectivity loss and reconnects gracefully.
--React Client
--Grid view of all participants with active-speaker highlighting.
--Mute/unmute mic, toggle camera, share screen.
--Device chooser for input/output.
--Connection quality indicators and adaptive bitrate/resolution.
--Automatic reconnection on network drops.
--Media & Quality Control
--Customizable getUserMedia constraints (HD, SD, Low).
--Simulcast or per-sender bitrate caps.
--Dynamic degradation preference under poor networks.
--Session Persistence (MongoDB)
--Stores room info, join/leave times, and call stats.
--Short-lived tokens for room access and participant sessions.
--Resilience & Security
--Auto reconnect with exponential backoff.
--Graceful teardown on tab close.
--JWT-based auth, CORS/origin checks, and optional end-to-end encryption (Insertable Streams).

Optional Enhancements:----
--In-room text chat and reactions using the same signaling channel.
--Structured logs, health endpoints, and basic metrics (participants, bitrate, packet loss).
--Local setup scripts for Node.js, MongoDB, React, and coturn.

Outcome:--
--A working small-group video conferencing prototype that demonstrates:
--Real-time WebRTC communication with adaptive behavior.
--Reliable NAT traversal and reconnection.
--Secure signaling and tokenized room access.
--Extendable foundation for full-scale conferencing apps.

🎯 Learning Outcomes:-------

--Understanding Real-Time Communication Concepts

--Building and Managing Peer Connections
--Gain practical experience in setting up and managing multiple RTCPeerConnections in a mesh topology for small group calls.
--Learn how to handle renegotiation, screen sharing, and dynamic track replacement.
--Implementing Signaling Mechanisms
--Learn to build a Node.js WebSocket signaling server for session orchestration.
--Understand offer/answer exchange, ICE candidate relay, and room-level presence updates.
--Developing Real-Time React Interfaces
--Build an interactive React UI for live video tiles, mute/unmute, camera toggle, and screen share.
--Learn to manage local/remote media streams and device selection using getUserMedia() and MediaStreamTrack APIs.
--Network and Media Quality Management
--Learn techniques for bandwidth adaptation, simulcast, and quality control under varying network conditions.
--Understand how to monitor connection health and adjust parameters dynamically.
--Session Persistence and State Handling
--Use MongoDB to store room data, participants, and call statistics.
--Learn to design schemas for real-time systems and manage transient vs persistent data.
--Security and Authentication in WebRTC Systems
--Understand JWT-based authentication, room-scoped tokens, and CORS/WebSocket origin validation.
--Explore optional end-to-end encryption (E2EE) concepts using Insertable Streams.
--Resilience and Error Recovery
--Implement auto-reconnect, ICE restarts, and graceful teardown mechanisms for reliable performance.
--Learn to design recovery logic using exponential backoff and retry policies.
--DevOps and Observability Skills
--Learn how to log, monitor, and measure system performance (participants count, bitrate, latency).
--Gain hands-on experience setting up local dev environments for Node.js, React, MongoDB, and TURN servers.
--Team Collaboration and Full-Stack Integration
--Apply both frontend and backend skills to build a complete real-time web application.
--Understand the importance of coordination between UI, signaling, and network layers.
