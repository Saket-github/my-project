For the HTML, I first created a hidden checkbox that works as a theme switch between light and dark mode. Then I built a main container called `dashboard` that holds the header, sidebar, main content, and footer. In the header, I added the title “Admin Dashboard” and a dark mode toggle made from a label linked to the hidden checkbox with a small square box and “Dark Mode” text. The sidebar contains navigation links for Home, Users, and Settings, the main section has a welcome message and placeholder text for dashboard content, and the footer shows copyright information.

For the CSS, I started by setting up light theme colors using CSS variables in `:root`. Then I defined a dark theme that activates when the checkbox is checked, changing background, text, and element colors. I styled the body to use these variables and used CSS Grid to arrange the dashboard into header, sidebar, main content, and footer areas. Each section has its own background, padding, and color styling, and the dark mode box in the header changes its fill when dark mode is active.
