In this experiment I have created a student registration form.
In the starting of body tag I use the heading tag to show the name of the form.
Then I use, form tag to make the form.
Now in form tag I use label tag which tells the user that we have to write the name here. Here we use for="name" 
which tells user that this label is linked with which input field.
Then I make a input field in which I use type(text,numbers,etc.), id, name(optional), placeholder(which shows hint
in the input box), required(which make the thing mandatory), minlength or maxlength of the text.
Then use of break tag for breaking line or for giving space.
Then again uses the label and input tag for email and age.
And in the last I have created a submit button for submitting the form using input tag.
Finally close the form, body and html tag respectively.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> this line is used in head section which link the external css file with
html file. This external css file helps us to do styling(colors, font, spacing,etc.) in the form, as I give red 
color as a background color.
